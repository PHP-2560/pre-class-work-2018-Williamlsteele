Read the source code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names.
``` {r}
are_strings_equal <- function(string, prefix) {
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
}
remove_last_value <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
  x[-length(x)]
}
rep_y_x_times <- function(x, y) {
  rep(y, length.out = length(x))
}
```
Compare and contrast rnorm() and MASS::mvrnorm(). How could you make them more consistent?

Use lapply() and an anonymous function to find the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean) for all columns in the mtcars dataset.

Use vapply() to: a. Compute the standard deviation of every column in a numeric data frame. b. Compute the standard deviation of every numeric column in a mixed data frame. (Hint: youâ€™ll need to use vapply() twice.)
